Assignment: Battleship Game
- Create an array of 5 numbers - (0,1,1,0,1)
- Imagine that we are building a game. The places where 1's are present are our positions of battleships.
- Now keep on asking the user for any number between 1 to 5.
    If the user enters an invalid number alert that 'Enter a valid number'.
- Each time user enters a number increment the (guesses) count by 1.
- If the number user has entered matches with the position of the battleships
    (i.e 2, 3 and 5), then alert that 'You have hit a battleship'. Increment the hit count by 1.
- If the number user has entered doesn't match with the position of the battleships
    (ie. 1, 4), then alert that 'You missed the battleship'.
- The game will stop if the total successful hits are made. (3 hits)
- Display total count of guesses.
